### Thinkpads are not Repairable*

#### *without third-party help

I love Thinkpads. I have a x230, t440, and t440s. The t440 is my daily driver, getting around 10 hours of battery life. It's a great machine, has upgradeable parts, and really I have no complaints about it. 

I believe, however, that it is not repairable in the conventional sense. Most consumer electronics that aren't appliances are not repairable. 

Repairability is full control over a device, including software, firmware, and hardware. If a part is to be replaced, it can be done so without modifications. If modifications are desired, one can perform them without hurdles.  

Thinkpads do not fit that description, despite what the internet would like you to believe.  

The BIOS on an older Thinkpad, save for a few models here and there, has a lock on what components can be installed. To get around this, BIOS replacements like Skulls and Heads have been released. Flashing the BIOS isn't blocked by any means, making the process seamless. The issue I have with this is the necessity. You're almost expected to, on older models, flash the BIOS and change the wireless card. Upgrading the screen takes no special tools or BIOS flashing, however, sourcing the panels is a chore. Often, the panels are not available.  

Keyboard replacement with older models (t420 era) to the newer chassis requires BIOS flashing. Why does a genuine Thinkpad keyboard need modification to work in a genuine Thinkpad body on a genuine Thinkpad motherboard?  

I believe Thinkpads should have licensed third-party manufacturers for replacement parts going back to the T-series. Batteries, panels, keyboards, trackpads, trackpad buttons, power buttons, etc, should be stocked. 

New Thinkpads are prohibitively expensive for a mediocre product. Thus, Thinkpad buyers shift to the used market, getting damaged laptops. They're not all broken beyond considerable use. Those that are will require a new touchpad, keyboard, battery, or display panel most often. My laptops have been well taken care of, and I'm grateful for that.  

The wonderful aspect of the Thinkpad *is* the modding community. I am merely of the mind that a Thinkpad enthusiast should not recommend them on the basis of repairability, rather their other qualities. 12 hours of battery life for $40 is not something to shake a stick at.
